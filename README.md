### Rules for custom enchantment
1. Before PR a new enchantment, ensure a corresponding issue is created for discussion
2. Keep it balanced, no OP
3. Ensure it can't be abused. Idea: reduce item's durability, define conflicts
4. No "permanent effect" enchantment! e.g: grant "speed" while wearing armour
5. Chance is preferred over "cooldown"
